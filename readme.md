# OpenPoll
The world first completely open source polling platform



## The problem
Currenty polling is not well put together... each major news company will run their own polls, which leads to a bias. The only people that visit those websites are people that agree with those views, and that will be shown in their polls.

## Solution
OpenPolls is designed to solve all problems with polls. Being open source, anyone can peek in the code to ensure no fraud, and anyone can spin up their own OpenPoll platforms, and tailor them for their own use.
